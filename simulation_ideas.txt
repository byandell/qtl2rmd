notes

flip around slurm and use sbatch in bash script loop to do simulations

remove target fit from mediation_test; get it elseways
return to two driver model, or at least compare in simulations to mediator driver

use 2-level SNP for mRNA mediators

simulation ideas

regress target on driver D->T and randomize residuals
  qtl2::fit1 returns $fitted
  use target driver
goal: keep relationships:
  T ~ D
  D ~ C
  M ~ C
  so, are we forcing independent model? yes
  except allows T -> M sometimes
  force indep by also randomizing residuals for C->M
  
could also look at keeping
  M ~ T
  but break connection with D,C
  then C/R/I/U should be equivalent
  
could also simulate D->T->M -- how?

do strict simulation given C and D
simulate C/R/I
